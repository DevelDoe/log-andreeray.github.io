title: React - Requiring the library
category:
  - React
---
React's homepage is located at http://facebook.github.io/react/. There, we'll also locate the downloads available for us so that we can include them in our project. 

There are different ways to include and use the library.

* We can make use of bower or install via npm. 
* We can also just include it as an individual download, directly available from the fb.me domain. 
* There are development versions that are full version of the library as well as production version which is its minified version. 
* There is also its version of add-on. We'll take a look at this later though."

You can simply add it in your header like so:  
```html
<script src="http://fb.me/react-0.13.0.js"></script>
```
