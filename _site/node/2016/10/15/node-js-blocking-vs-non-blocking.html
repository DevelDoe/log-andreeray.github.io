<p><em>This article covers the difference between blocking and non-blocking calls in Node.js. The original article can be found at https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/topics/blocking-vs-non-blocking.md. Here I am attempting to mimplify and clarify the article.</em></p>

<h2 id="blocking">Blocking</h2>

<p>Blocking is when the execution of additional JavaScript in the Node.js process must wait until a non-JavaScript operation completes, this happens because the event loop is unable to continue running JavaScript while a blocking operation is occurring.</p>

<p>In Node.js, JavaScript that exhibits poor performance due to being CPU intensive, rather than waiting on a non-JavaScript operation, such as I/O, isn’t typically referred to as blocking.</p>

<p>Synchronous methods in the Node.js standard library that use libuv are the most commonly used blocking operations. Native modules may also have blocking methods.</p>

<p>All of the I/O methods in the Node.js standard library provide asynchronous versions, which are non-blocking, and accept callback functions. Some methods also have blocking counterparts, which have names that end with Sync.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-code">Comparing Code</h2>

<p>Blocking methods execute synchronously and non-blocking methods execute asynchronously.</p>

<p>Using the File System module as an example, this is a synchronous file read:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">fs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'fs'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">fs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">readFileSync</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/file.md'</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// blocks here until file is read</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And here is an equivalent asynchronous example:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">fs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'fs'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">fs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">readFile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/file.md'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The first example appears simpler than the second but has the disadvantage of the second line blocking the execution of any additional JavaScript until the entire file is read. Note that in the synchronous version if an error is thrown it will need to be caught or the process will crash. In the asynchronous version, it is up to the author to decide whether an error should throw as shown.</p>

<p>Let’s expand our example a little bit:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">fs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'fs'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">fs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">readFileSync</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/file.md'</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// blocks here until file is read</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">// moreWork(); will run after console.log</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And here is a similar, but not equivalent asynchronous example:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">fs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'fs'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">fs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">readFile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/file.md'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
<span class="c1">// moreWork(); will run before console.log</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In the first example above, console.log will be called before moreWork(). In the second example fs.readFile() is non-blocking so JavaScript execution can continue and moreWork() will be called first. The ability to run moreWork() without waiting for the file read to complete is a key design choice that allows for higher throughput.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency-and-throughput">Concurrency and Throughput</h2>

<p>JavaScript execution in Node.js is single threaded, so concurrency refers to the event loop’s capacity to execute JavaScript callback functions after completing other work. Any code that is expected to run in a concurrent manner must allow the event loop to continue running as non-JavaScript operations, like I/O, are occurring.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s consider a case where each request to a web server takes 50ms to complete and 45ms of that 50ms is database I/O that can be done asynchronously. Choosing non-blocking asynchronous operations frees up that 45ms per request to handle other requests. This is a significant difference in capacity just by choosing to use non-blocking methods instead of blocking methods.</p>

<p>The event loop is different than models in many other languages where additional threads may be created to handle concurrent work.</p>

<h2 id="dangers-of-mixing-blocking-and-non-blocking-code">Dangers of Mixing Blocking and Non-Blocking Code</h2>

<p>There are some patterns that should be avoided when dealing with I/O. Let’s look at an example:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">fs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'fs'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">fs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">readFile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/file.md'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
<span class="nx">fs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">unlinkSync</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/file.md'</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In the above example, fs.unlinkSync() is likely to be run before fs.readFile(), which would delete file.md before it is actually read. A better way to write this that is completely non-blocking and guaranteed to execute in the correct order is:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">fs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'fs'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">fs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">readFile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/file.md'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nx">fs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">unlink</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/file.md'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The above places a non-blocking call to fs.unlink() within the callback of fs.readFile() which guarantees the correct order of operations.</p>
