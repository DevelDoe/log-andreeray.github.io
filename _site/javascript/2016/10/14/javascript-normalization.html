<p>Unicode allows more than one way of encoding the same character.</p>

<p>The string “é” can be encoded as tht single Unicode character \u0oE9 or as the regular ASCII e followed by the accent mark \u0301.</p>

<p>The two encoding may look exactly the same in a text editor, but thay have different binary encoding and are considered different by the computer. Unicode standard defines the prefered encoding for all characters and specifies a normalization procedure to convert text to a cronical form suitable for comparison.</p>

<p>JS assumes that the source code it interpreting has already been normalized and makes no attempt to normalize identifiers, strings, or regular expressions itself.</p>
