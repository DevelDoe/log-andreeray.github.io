<p>JS ignores spaces that appear between tokens in programs. For the most part JS also ignores line breaks.</p>

<p>In addition to the regular space character (\u0020) JS also recognizes tab (\u0009), and any other Unicode cat Zs as whitespace. JS recognizes the following characters as line terminators:</p>

<ul>
  <li>line feed (\u000A)</li>
  <li>carriage return (\u000D)</li>
  <li>line separator (\u2028)</li>
  <li>paragraph separator (\u2029)</li>
</ul>

<p>A Carrage return and line feed sequence is treated as a single line terminator. Unicode format control (cat Cf e.g. RIGHT-TO-LEFT) control the visual presentation of the text thay occur in.
Thay are important for the proper display of some non-English languages and are allowed in JS comments, string literals, and regular expressions literals, but not in the identifiers.</p>

<p>Special case for ZERO WIDTH JOINER and ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINERS are allowed for identifiers, but not as the first character.</p>
