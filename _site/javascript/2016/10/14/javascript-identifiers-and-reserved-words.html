<p>Identifiers are used to name variables and functions and to provide labels for certain loops.</p>

<p>An identifier can consist of a letter, underscore, number or a $ sign. 
Numbers are not allowed as the first character so that JS can easily distinguish them from numbers.</p>

<p>For poprtablility and ease of editing, it is common to use only ASCII letters and digits in identifiers.</p>

<p><strong>JS allows identifiers to contain letters and digits from the entire Unicode char set. 
This allows programmers to use variable names from non-English language and also to use matimatical symbols.</strong></p>
