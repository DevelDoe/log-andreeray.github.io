<p>JS Supports two styles of comments.</p>

<p>Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored.
Any text between /* */ is also treated as a comment; these comments may span multiple lines, but may not be nested.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// This is a single line comment</span>

<span class="cm">/* this 
 * is a 
 * multiline comment area.
 */</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
