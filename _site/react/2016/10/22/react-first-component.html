<p>The entry point to the ReactJS library is the React object and is made available to us in the global JavaScript namespace.</p>

  <p>Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. React.Component is provided by React.(facebook.github.io, 2016)</p>

<p>React.createClass creates a component with the given specification. The component must implement the render method that returns a single child element.</p>

<p>React will take care of calling the render method of the component to generate the HTML.</p>

<p><strong>Even if the render method needs to return a single child, that single child can have an arbitrarily deep structure to contain full-fledged HTML page parts.</strong></p>

<p>Here, we are making use of React.createElement to create our content.</p>

<p>It’s a singleton method that allows us to create a div element with the content.</p>

<p>React.createElement creates a ReactElement, which is an internal representation of the DOM element used by React.</p>

<p>We are passing null as the second argument. This is used to pass and specify attributes for the element. Right now, we are leaving it as blank to create a simple div.</p>

<p>The type of ReactElement can be either a valid HTML tag name like <code class="highlighter-rouge">span</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">h1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">p</code>and so on. Or, it can be component created by React.createClass itself.</p>

<p>Once done creating the component, it can be displayed using the React.render method. Here a new ReactElemtn is created for the App component that we have created and it is rendered into the HTML element <code class="highlighter-rouge">body</code>.</p>

<p>This is called the mountNode, or mount point for our component and acts as the root node. Instead of passing document.body directly as a container for the component, any other DOM element can be passed.</p>

<p>While constructing the first conponent, we also got an overview of React’stop-level API, that is, making use of React.createClass, React.createElement and React.render.</p>
