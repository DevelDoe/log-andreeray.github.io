<p>The various Markdown renderers supported by Jekyll sometimes have extra options available.</p>

<h2 id="redcarpet">Redcarpet</h2>
<p>Redcarpet can be configured by providing an extensions sub-setting, whose value should be an array of strings. Each string should be the name of one of the Redcarpet::Markdown class’s extensions; if present in the array, it will set the corresponding extension to true.</p>

<p>Jekyll handles two special Redcarpet extensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>no_fenced_code_blocks</strong> — By default, Jekyll sets the fenced_code_blocks extension (for delimiting code blocks with triple tildes or triple backticks) to true, probably because GitHub’s eager adoption of them is starting to make them inescapable. Redcarpet’s normal fenced_code_blocks extension is inert when used with Jekyll; instead, you can use this inverted version of the extension for disabling fenced code.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note that you can also specify a language for highlighting after the first delimiter:</strong></p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> ```ruby
    ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>```</p>

<p>With both fenced code blocks and highlighter enabled, this will statically highlight the code; without any syntax highlighter, it will add a class=”LANGUAGE” attribute to the <code> element, which can be used as a hint by various JavaScript code highlighting libraries.</code></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>smart</strong> — This pseudo-extension turns on SmartyPants, which converts straight quotes to curly quotes and runs of hyphens to em (—) and en (–) dashes.</li>
</ul>

<p>All other extensions retain their usual names from Redcarpet, and no renderer options aside from smart can be specified in Jekyll. A list of available extensions can be found in the Redcarpet README file. Make sure you’re looking at the README for the right version of Redcarpet: Jekyll currently uses v3.2.x. The most commonly used extensions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tables</li>
  <li>no_intra_emphasis</li>
  <li>autolink</li>
</ul>
