<p>The Jekyll gem makes a jekyll executable available to you in your Terminal window. You can use this command in a number of ways:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>jekyll build
<span class="c"># =&gt; The current folder will be generated into ./_site</span>

<span class="gp">$ </span>jekyll build --destination &lt;destination&gt;
<span class="c"># =&gt; The current folder will be generated into &lt;destination&gt;</span>

<span class="gp">$ </span>jekyll build --source &lt;<span class="nb">source</span>&gt; --destination &lt;destination&gt;
<span class="c"># =&gt; The &lt;source&gt; folder will be generated into &lt;destination&gt;</span>

<span class="gp">$ </span>jekyll build --watch
<span class="c"># =&gt; The current folder will be generated into ./_site,</span>
<span class="c">#    watched for changes, and regenerated automatically.</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><em>The _config.yml master configuration file contains global configurations and variable definitions that are read once at execution time. Changes made to _config.yml during automatic regeneration are not loaded until the next execution.
Note Data Files are included and reloaded during automatic regeneration.</em></p>

<p>**The contents of <destination> are automatically cleaned, by default, when the site is built. Files or folders that are not created by your site will be removed. Files and folders you wish to retain in <destination> may be specified within the <keep_files> configuration directive.
Do not use an important location for <destination>; instead, use it as a staging area and copy files from there to your web server.**</destination></keep_files></destination></destination></p>

<p>Jekyll also comes with a built-in development server that will allow you to preview what the generated site will look like in your browser locally.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>jekyll serve
<span class="c"># =&gt; A development server will run at http://localhost:4000/</span>
<span class="c"># Auto-regeneration: enabled. Use `--no-watch` to disable.</span>

<span class="gp">$ </span>jekyll serve --detach
<span class="c"># =&gt; Same as `jekyll serve` but will detach from the current terminal.</span>
<span class="c">#    If you need to kill the server, you can `kill -9 1234` where "1234" is the PID.</span>
<span class="c">#    If you cannot find the PID, then do, `ps aux | grep jekyll` and kill the instance. [Read more](http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/shell/jobz5.html).</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><em>As of version 2.4, the serve command will watch for changes automatically. To disable this, you can use jekyll serve –no-watch, which preserves the old behavior.</em></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>jekyll serve --no-watch
<span class="c"># =&gt; Same as `jekyll serve` but will not watch for changes.</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These are just a few of the available <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/">configuration options</a>. Many configuration options can either be specified as flags on the command line, or alternatively (and more commonly) they can be specified in a _config.yml file at the root of the source directory. Jekyll will automatically use the options from this file when run. For example, if you place the following lines in your _config.yml file:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">source</span>:      _source
destination: _deploy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then the following two commands will be equivalent:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>jekyll build
<span class="gp">$ </span>jekyll build --source _source --destination _deploy
</code></pre>
</div>
