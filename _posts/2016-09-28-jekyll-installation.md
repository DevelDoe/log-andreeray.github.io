When installing Jekyll there are a few requirements you’ll need to make sure your system has before you start.

* Ruby (including development headers, v1.9.3 or above for Jekyll 2 and v2 or above for Jekyll 3)
* RubyGems
* Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X
* NodeJS, or another JavaScript runtime (Jekyll 2 and earlier, for CoffeeScript support).
* Python 2.7 (for Jekyll 2 and earlier)

## Install with RubyGems
The best way to install Jekyll is via RubyGems. At the terminal prompt, simply run the following command to install Jekyll:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

*If you are using OS X you need to have Xcode installed.*

## Optional Extras
There are a number of extra features that Jekyll supports that you may want to install, depending on how you plan to use Jekyll. These extras include LaTeX support, and the use of alternative content rendering engines.

**Chances are you’ll want to enable syntax highlighting using Pygments or Rouge. [How to do that](http://develdoe.com/2016/jekyll-code-snippet-highlighting/).**
