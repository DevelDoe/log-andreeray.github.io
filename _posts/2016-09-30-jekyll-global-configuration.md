Jekyll allows you to concoct your sites in any way you can dream up, and it’s thanks to the powerful and flexible configuration options that this is possible. These options can either be specified in a _config.yml file placed in your site’s root directory, or can be specified as flags for the jekyll executable in the terminal.

The table below lists the available settings for Jekyll, and the various options (specified in the configuration file) and flags (specified on the command-line) that control them.

|SETTING|OPTIONS AND FLAGS|
|:---------|------:|
|**Site Source** Change the directory where Jekyll will read files|source: DIR -s, --source DIR|
|**Site Destination** Change the directory where Jekyll will write files|destination: DIR -d, --destination DIR|
|**Safe** Disable custom plugins, and ignore symbolic links|safe: BOOL --safe|
|**Exclude** Exclude directories and/or files from the conversion. These exclusions are relative to the site's source directory and cannot be outside the source directory|exclude: [DIR, FILE, ...]|
|**Include** Force inclusion of directories and/or files in the conversion.  .htaccess is a good example since dotfiles are excluded by default.|include: [DIR, FILE, ...]|
|**Keep files** When clobbering the site destination, keep the selected files. Useful for files that are not generated by jekyll; e.g. files or assets that are generated by your build tool. The paths are relative to the destination.|keep_files: [DIR, FILE, ...]|
|**Time Zone** Set the time zone for site generation. This sets the TZ environment variable, which Ruby uses to handle time and date creation and manipulation. Any entry from the IANA Time Zone Database is valid, e.g. America/New_York. A list of all available values can be found here. The default is the local time zone, as set by your operating system.|timezone: TIMEZONE|
|**Encoding** Set the encoding of files by name (only available for Ruby 1.9 or later). The default value is utf-8 starting in 2.0.0, and nil before 2.0.0, which will yield the Ruby default of ASCII-8BIT. Available encodings can be shown by the command ruby -e 'puts Encoding::list.join("\n")'|encoding: ENCODING|
|**Defaults** Set defaults for YAML Front Matter variables.|see below|

**The contents of &lt;destination&gt; are automatically cleaned, by default, when the site is built. Files or folders that are not created by your site will be removed. Some files could be retained by specifying them within the &lt;keep_files&gt; configuration directive.**
