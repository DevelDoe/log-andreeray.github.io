JS Supports two styles of comments. 

Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored.
Any text between /* */ is also treated as a comment; these comments may span multiple lines, but may not be nested.

```javascript
// This is a single line comment

/* this 
 * is a 
 * multiline comment area.
 */
```
