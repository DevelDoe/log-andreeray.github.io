Identifiers are used to name variables and functions and to provide labels for certain loops.

An identifier can consist of a letter, underscore, number or a $ sign. 
Numbers are not allowed as the first character so that JS can easily distinguish them from numbers.

For poprtablility and ease of editing, it is common to use only ASCII letters and digits in identifiers. 

 
**JS allows identifiers to contain letters and digits from the entire Unicode char set. 
This allows programmers to use variable names from non-English language and also to use matimatical symbols.**
