title: React - JavaScriptX introduction
---
JSX is an XML like syntax extension but without any defined semantics. it has a familiar syntax for designers and non-programmers, and it can be used directly from a JS file.

```javascript
var App = React.createClass({
  render: function(){
    return (
        <div>Hello JSX</div>
    )
  }
})
```

**In order for this to work you must make use of th JSX transformer library.**
